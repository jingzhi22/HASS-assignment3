      Houses are valued differly according to the town they are in. Two houses of the same size can fetch a different price simply by the different in location.
    </li>
    <li>
      To index the average value of houses per town, we map the average price per square meter (PPSM) of each unit sold within the town boundaries.
    </li>
    <li>
      PPSM is calculated by diving the price of the unit by the floor area of the unit. This is visuliaed using the size of the dollar sign. Larger the sign, higher the value.
